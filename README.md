# Recommendation Projects

This repository contains two Streamlit-based recommendation apps:

- `book-recommendation` for book recommendations
- `movie-recommendation` for movie recommendations

Both apps use Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The book app uses prebuilt artifacts in `book-recommendation/artifact/`, while the movie app reads from `movie-recommendation/artifact/` and fetches posters from The Movie Database API.

## Project Structure

- `book-recommendation/` - book recommender app, notebook, artifacts, and source data
- `movie-recommendation/` - movie recommender app, notebook, artifacts, and source data
- `requirement.txt` - shared Python dependencies

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/007ash/Recommendation-Projects.git
   cd Recommendation-Projects
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

## Run the Apps

Run each app from its own folder:

```bash
cd book-recommendation
streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
cd movie-recommendation
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes

- The movie recommender requires internet access to load poster images.
- The apps expect the artifact files already present in the repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or want to improve the project, open an issue or submit a pull request.
